*  - `settings.evaluation.agentEvalsEnabled` — the backend-provided operator
*    override (`N8N_AGENT_EVALS_ENABLED`). Delivered in the settings payload,
*    so it works even when the in-browser PostHog client never initializes
*    (telemetry off), where the flag would otherwise stay false.
*  - the PostHog client flag — carries per-cohort rollout when telemetry is on.
*
* Coerces to a strict boolean so `v-if="isAgentEvalsEnabled"` never
* undefined-flickers during the initial flag-fetch frame.
